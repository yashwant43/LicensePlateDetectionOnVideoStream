**1.1 Aim**
Main aim of the project is to develop a License Plate Recognition Program which
recognizes different types of characters in an image and gives specific extracted output
form a video stream in text format.
**1.2 Objective**
The objective of this project is to extract characters from a License Plate with
the use of Deep Learning algorithms and Computer Vision libraries. A suitable
algorithm needs to be constructed and trained for different sets of images. The
program code must be written in Python with the inclusion of suitable OpenCV
libraries. The program should be able to extract the characters and print the output
in text format for training purpose.
